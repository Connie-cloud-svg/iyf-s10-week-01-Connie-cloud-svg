            <h2>Background Story</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Concepter Bosibori, born and raised in the vibrant country of Kenya. Growing up in a household
                filled with creativity and curiosity, I was always encouraged to explore my interests and pursue my 
                passions. After completing my primary education with a strong foundation, I realized that my love 
                for innovation and problem-solving was leading me towards a path in engineering. 
                The inspiration stemmed from my experiences with my brother and sister, who both nurtured my innate 
                curiosity by challenging me to build and create things. These early moments sparked my passion for 
                understanding how things work and how I can improve or innovate upon them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Engineering, for me, isn’t just a career choice; it’s a calling that allows me to leverage my creativity 
                to solve real-world problems. I enjoy working on projects that require both analytical skills and 
                imaginative thinking. My journey so far has been enriching, and I am excited about the possibilities 
                that lie ahead.
